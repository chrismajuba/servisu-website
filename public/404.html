      IMPORTANT: For GitHub Pages to work with React Router (BrowserRouter),
      you need to copy the built index.html to 404.html after each build.
      
      This file should be identical to index.html after build. The scripts
      below will be replaced by the build process with your React app bundle.
      
      To automate this, add this to your package.json scripts:
      "build": "react-scripts build && cp build/index.html build/404.html"
      
      Or create a post-build script that copies index.html to 404.html
      in your build folder.
